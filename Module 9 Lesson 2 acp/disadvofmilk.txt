While milk is often promoted for its calcium and nutrients, it does have several potential disadvantages, particularly for some individuals. These include lactose intolerance, potential for increased cholesterol and heart disease risk due to saturated fat content, and possible links to acne and certain cancers.
Lactose Intolerance:
Many people, particularly adults, experience lactose intolerance, meaning their bodies don't produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, a sugar in milk. This can lead to digestive issues like bloating, gas, and diarrhea. 
Saturated Fat and Cholesterol:
Milk, especially whole milk, contains saturated fat, which can raise levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol. High LDL cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease. 
Acne:
Some studies suggest a link between milk consumption and acne breakouts, particularly in adolescents and young adults. 
Cancer:
There's ongoing research regarding potential links between milk consumption and certain cancers, such as prostate and ovarian cancer.
